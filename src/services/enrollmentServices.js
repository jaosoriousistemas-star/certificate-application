/**
 * Service class responsible for all business logic and database
 * operations related to the Enrollment (matricula) entity.
 *
 * Follows the Repository/Service Layer pattern described in AGENTS.md:
 * controllers never talk to Sequelize directly, they always go through
 * this class. Every public method returns an explicit status object
 * (or the requested record) instead of a bare boolean, so the
 * controller decides the proper HTTP response from that status.
 *
 * Both 'studentId' and 'groupId' are nullable at the database level
 * (see migrations/20260707184734-enrollment.cjs), since 'matricula'
 * references 'estudiante' and 'grupo' with onDelete: 'SET NULL' — this
 * lets an enrollment (and the historical academic record hanging off
 * it) survive even if the student or group is later removed. Creating
 * a new enrollment, however, is a deliberate business action that
 * always links a specific student to a specific group, so this service
 * requires both foreign keys at creation time, even though the column
 * itself allows NULL.
 *
 * The database enforces a composite unique index on
 * (id_estudiante_matricula, id_grupo_matricula) — a student can only be
 * enrolled once in the same group — but this service still checks that
 * combination explicitly before writing, per AGENTS.md section 6
 * ('Antes de mutar datos, se valida la existencia/condición previa'),
 * so a duplicate enrollment surfaces a clear Boom.conflict instead of
 * the raw ORM unique-constraint error.
 *
 * 'certificado' and 'calificacion' both reference 'matricula' with
 * onDelete: 'RESTRICT' — a certificate can only ever be issued once per
 * enrollment (context.md: reprints reuse the same certificate record),
 * and scores belong to the academic history tied to the enrollment.
 * The deletion guard below checks both.
 *
 * Every method that returns an Enrollment record (listOne, listAll,
 * listByStudent, listByGroup, getByStudentAndGroup) embeds its related
 * student and group as nested objects, rather than exposing the raw
 * 'studentId'/'groupId' foreign key integers.
